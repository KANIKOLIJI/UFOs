# UFOs
Java


## Overview of Project:
In this project we used Javascript to design a webpage that will provide information about mistries up in the sky. Those information were funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist, so we can supplement our sky-searching with data analysis in this project. The page contains a title, an article and a table that contains Data, so we can search some info based on some criteria, and filter the information that we need.


## Results:
The information can be filtered based on 5 criteria. We can filter the table based on date, city, country, state, and shape.

It is using the id when we search for something. It will search for key in the data and return the value of that key.


## Summary:
One drawback for this design would be slowness if all filters are going to be used at the same time. That makes the search much more slower.
